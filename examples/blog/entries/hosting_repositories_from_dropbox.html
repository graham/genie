The first thing you start using Dropbox for is your files, and maybe you keep a couple repos in there, but for the most part that's it.

Based on @anteries' recent post I felt obliged to write something that addressed this. Now frankly i'm a big GitHub fan, and I think what they've done for the Git community is huge. However, there are times when it's too heavyweight, especially if you need to share something basically private.

Now, that being said, the latest version of Dropbox provides this, not only does it allow you to share files, but it allows you to share any folder (yes ANY folder) within your Dropbox to anyone else behind a link that is effectively secure. (not actually secure, but it's behind a hash so you can't guess it).

Now, this is secure for most people, (any CS major should understand how this is secure).

Further more, you can add these "external" repos as a something that your local repo can pull from. In many ways it removes the cruft and allows git to act just like linus always wanted it to. Simple distributed development without the need to have users pushing to a single server. Because you always share what you have committed and because Dropbox is always syncing your data, you almost never have to worry about serving your Git Repos any where.

Lets look at an example, right now I have a git repo hosted here:

http://

You can clone it with the following command:

You can also pull into your local repo with the following command, should you make a patch and want me to see it, it's as easy as sharing a shmodel (it's what we call the new sharing model) link with me.

Caveats: this doesn't seem to work with hg yet, although I'm currently looking for a solution that will allow for this. Also you'll need to run:

"git do-server-stuff" first, although, in reality, this really isn't a big deal for what you get.

In closing I think that this will resolve a number of issues where maintainers are hosting files that they would rather be private in their github accounts and it makes it a little easier to do some things.

That being said I think lib-git2 will really help out with a ton of things.
