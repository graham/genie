purpose:
	Javascript is a nice language, i've been doing some work with NodeJS and I couldn't find any good Javascript templating engines. I think this is partly because there isn't a good workflow for doing these sorts of things.

So i've gone ahead and attempted to set one up.

Rendering templates server side can be really nice, it means that you have really good data locality, however, you have to do a good amount of work on the server each time you want to render a page.
