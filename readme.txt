This started as a javascript template library, but it's morphed a bit into a couple different useful javascript tools.

There are two major focuses of each module are that they should be 

      1. Self contained, not requiring a javascript library, (but they should also not interferre with any of them).
      2. They should be pretty self contained, i.e. base modules should not require 3 other javascript files to be included.

The genie project now includes the following tools.

    Genie Templates:
        Fast effective javascript templates.
    Kapture:
        Clean simple emacs style bindings for any web app.
